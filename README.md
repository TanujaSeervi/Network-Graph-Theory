# Network-Graph-Theory

This contains following type of Network/Graph and analysis of their Characteristic:

1. Real Un-Directed Network
2. Real Directed Network
3. Random Graph
4. Watts Strogatz Small World Model


Characteristics are:

1. Draw the graph
2. Number of nodes and edges, list of nodes and edges and number and list of cycles
3. Adjacency matrix
4. Degree of each node and degree distribution. Also, average degree, typical degree and nodes with the largest degree.
5. Following centrality measures and distribution. 
        a. Eigenvector Centrality
        b. Betweenness Centality
        c. Closeness Centrality
        d. Page Rank
        e. Katz Centrality
  
   Also, average respective centrality and nodes with the largest centrality value:
6. Geodesic Distance between each pair of node and  distribution. Also average distance and diameter.
7. Local Clustering Coefficient for each node and distribution. Also, average clustering coefficient and nodes with the largest local clustering coefficient.
8. Connectance , number of components and the size of the largest component
9. Is the graph scale free?
10. Does the graph show small world behavior? 
11. Is it supercritical?

Also, a comparitive study is presented among properties of Random Graph (G(n, p)), Watts Strogatz Small World Model and undirected graph.
